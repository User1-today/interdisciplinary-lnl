                        - Syria plunged into civil war as opposition forces armed themselves against Assad's regime.

                        - The U.S., Turkey, and Gulf Nations supported oppositional groups.
                        - Assad was defended by Iran and Hezbollah.
                        - It became sectarian and divided further by Sunni rebels opposed to Assad's largely Alawite government.
